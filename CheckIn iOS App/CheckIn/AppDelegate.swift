 How to save Date data to database? And images? **********

 login screen for admins with QR scanner
 hash the QR code for security.
 Use an identifier with each pass which is the hash of the pass info
 Create the time travel and complication update functionality for the watch
 multiple contacts
 allow for multiple check-in locations
 action menu on ipads
 QR code encryption via hashing and identifier?
 Scroll views?
 iPad optimization with action sheet so that it doesn't crash
 WATCH APP: Menu actions, settings updating, pass deletion, page becomeCurrentPage()
    Fix issue with signInController coming up twice when the user hasn't logged in before
    Perfect 3D Menu Items on each interface controller and add a refresh button to the Passes InterfaceController
 Keep track of all user defaults stored so that they can be deleted upon logout
 WIDGET (Today View Extension)
 Add 3D Touch menu actions to watch app. Work on communication and core data things
 Write extension for screen class that manages brightness
 Change editableBound on Login screen textFields to move with the animation
 Create Swift package thingy (like a Pod? for some of the IB designables and functions)
 Login screen!!
	- Create account, login with Facebook, login with Google, Create Check-in Location
	- Double screen part: first screen is how to log in
	- Animate in and out
	- Show True Pass icon but with an alpha < 1
 Add UserInfo keys to the 3D touch Quick Actions that represent their version / build number - DONE

Find out why I can't rename my CheckIn directories to something else lol
Create the CILocation class and maybe rename this to TRULocation
Override hashCode for each guest pass
Give each pass a unique identifier using its hashCode, and override hashCode for the Pass class - perhaps put the hashCode function into another class and make both the Core Data Pass class and the WatchKit app's Pass class subclass this new class that has the hash function?

Implement a HashMap in swift and use it to store the passes based on their identifiers
