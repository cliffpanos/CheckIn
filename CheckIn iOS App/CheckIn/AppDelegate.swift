/* Finish geofences and CheckIn notifications
 CloudKit + other kits
 Fix 3D Touch quick actions
 other peek & commit interaction
 login screen for admins with QR scanner
 hash?
 multiple contacts
 allow for multiple checkin locations
 action menu on ipads
 QR code encryption via hashing?
 Make map zoom to checkin location, not user location
 Scroll views?
 iPad optimization with action sheet so that it doesn't crash
 WATCH APP!!
 WIDGET
 implement search bar functionality & FIX IT since it currently selects the wrong option
 Add 3D Touch menu actions to watch app. Work on communication and core data things
 Write extension for screen class that manages brightness
 Change editableBound on Login screen textFields to move with the animation
 Organize code into the Managers and file structure
 Create Swift package thingy (like a Pod? for some of the IB designables and functions)
 Login screen!!
	- Create account, login with Facebook, login with Google, Create CheckIn Location
	- Double screen part: first screen is how to log in
	- Animate in and out
	- Show checkin icon but with an alpha < 1
