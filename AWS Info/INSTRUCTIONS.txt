Things to note:
Go to: https://www.nginx.com/blog/setting-up-nginx/

- All NGINX stuff is in the root directory
	must begin with /
- the main directories are:
	 /etc/nginx
	 /public_html
	 /data

- within data is images

Whenever dealing with root folders and files, you must use sudo
	To avoid this, go to where the directory is and type:
	sudo chown ec2-user directory_name


TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT WEBPAGE back to the original:
	go to /etc/nginx/conf.d and change the virtualâ€¦ file to be virtual.conf
