# HackGSU Project: originally called "CheckIn", now called "True Pass"
This repository holds the code for the web app and iOS app that we created at the Spring 2017 Georgia State University Hackathon. Our project eases the check-in authorization process for offices and apartments.

# True Pass iOS & watchOS apps
True Pass is truly the best way to manage and optimize the check-in process for any type of location. From businesses to homes, schools and apartments, True Pass allows members to securely enter locations using a Pass containing a QR code, and it even manages entry with geofences. True Pass can also be used to easily send guests a guest pass that works for a specific amount of time. True Pass is backed by FireBase and is ready to optimize and manage any location.

# True Pass WebApp
The True Pass web app provides an online user interface where administrators can see the current visitors to their property, manage their property through a map interface, manager users, and generate QR codes. Currently, the UI is set up for this interface but the back-end is not implemented so that the WebApp can inteface with the iOS app.

# True Pass Android App
See my repository called "True Pass Android" for the Android implementation of this system.
