# HackGSU Project: CheckIn
This repository holds the code for the web app and iOS app that we created at the Spring 2017 Georgia State University Hackathon. Our project eases the check-in authorization process for offices and apartments.

# CheckIn WebApp
The CheckIn web app provides an online user interface where administrators can see the current visitors to their property, manage their property through a map interface, manager users, and generate QR codes. Currently, the UI is set up for this interface but the back-end is not implemented so that the WebApp can inteface with the iOS app.

# CheckIn iOS app
The CheckIn iOS provides an app interface for users to interact with the CheckIn system. Users can send and recieve passes that allow them entry to CheckIn buildlings via a QR code. Currently, the UI is set up for this interface but the back-end is not implemented so that the WebApp can inteface with the iOS app.
