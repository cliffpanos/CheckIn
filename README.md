# HackGSU Project: originally called "CheckIn", now called "True Pass"
This repository holds the code for the web app and iOS app that we created at the Spring 2017 Georgia State University Hackathon. Our project eases the check-in authorization process for offices and apartments.

# True Pass WebApp
The True Pass web app provides an online user interface where administrators can see the current visitors to their property, manage their property through a map interface, manager users, and generate QR codes. Currently, the UI is set up for this interface but the back-end is not implemented so that the WebApp can inteface with the iOS app.

# True Pass iOS app
The True Pass iOS provides an interface for users to interact with the True Pass system. Users can send and recieve True Passes that allow them to enter registered buildlings via a QR code. Currently, the UI is set up for this interface, and the back-end is being implemented so that the WebApp can inteface with the iOS app.
